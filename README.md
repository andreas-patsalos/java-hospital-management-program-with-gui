# java-hospital-management-program-with-gui
A multi-floor hospital management program with GUI using Java and its GUI libraries, created as part of the coursework of my Object Oriented Programming course that I got an A mark at the end of the semester.

When running the code, the default password to pass the login screen is "1" (without the quotation marks).
